Header Files for Integration with SGX quote-ex Library
====

This directory contains the header files retrieved from the Intel SGX SDK,
that are needed for compiling the OE SDK host library for SGX platforms,
when the SGX quote-ex library is integrated. Retrieval of the header files
remove the dependency of installation of the full Intel SGX SDK on build
platforms.

For more information about quote-ex integration, please refer to the design
document [SGX_quoteEx_Integration.md](../../docs/DesignDocs/SGX_QuoteEx_Integration.md)
