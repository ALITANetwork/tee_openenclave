OpenSSL tests
=============

This directory includes the unit tests from OpenSSL (under `openssl/test`). The tests are partitioned
into three categories as follows.

* tests.supported.buildtest - The tests generated by the openssl/test/generate_buildtest.pl script.
* tests.supported - The rest of tests that are supported by OE.
* tests.unsupported - The tests that are currently not supported by OE or disabled.
