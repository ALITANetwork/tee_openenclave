**==============================================================================
**
** This definition was copied and modified from MUSL. The original stdout
** definition initializes the FILE.lock field to -1, which suppresses locking.
** The MUSL FLOCK macro is defined as follows:
**
**     #define FLOCK(f) int __need_unlock = ((f)->lock>=0 ? __lockfile((f)) : 0)
**
** Note that __lockfile is not called when FILE.lock is negative one. When
** multiple threads write to stdout or stderr, they eventually call the
** following function without acquiring a lock (via FLOCK).
**
**     size_t __fwritex(const unsigned char* s, size_t l, FILE* f);
**
** This function modifies the state of the file stream and sometimes crashes
** (segmentation violation) when called on the same stream by multiple threads.
