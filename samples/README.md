# Open Enclave SDK Samples

All the samples that come with the Open Enclave SDK installation share a similar directory structure and build instructions. This document describes how to set up, build, sign, and run these samples.

## Common Sample information

### How Sample source code directories are structured

The Open Enclave SDK helps developers build enclave applications. An enclave application is partitioned into an untrusted component (called a host) and a trusted component (called an enclave). An enclave is a secure container whose memory (text and data) is protected from access by outside entities, including the host, privileged users, and even the hardware.

All functionality that needs to be run in a Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) should be compiled into the enclave binary. The enclave may be used by an untrusted environment with the expectation that secrets will not be compromised.

A host is a normal user mode application that creates and interacts with an enclave.

### Building the Samples

The steps required to build and run the samples on Linux are described in [BuildSamplesLinux.md](./BuildSamplesLinux.md). In order to build and run the samples on Windows, please see [BuildSamplesWindows.md](./BuildSamplesWindows.md).

## Samples

The following samples demonstrate how to develop enclave applications using OE APIs. It's recommended to go through the following samples in the order listed.

#### [HelloWorld](helloworld/README.md)

- Minimum code needed for an OE app
- Help understand the basic components an OE application
- Demonstrate how to build, sign, and run an OE image
- Demonstrate how to optionally apply LVI mitigation to SGX enclave code

#### [File-Encryptor](file-encryptor/README.md)

- Show how to encrypt and decrypt data inside an enclave
- Use AES mbedTLS API to perform encryption and decryption

#### [Data-Sealing](data-sealing/README.md)

- Introduce OE sealing and unsealing features
- Demonstrate how to use OE sealing APIs
- Explore two supported seal polices
  - OE_SEAL_POLICY_UNIQUE
  - OE_SEAL_POLICY_PRODUCT

#### [Attestation](attestation/README.md)

- Explain how OE attestation works
- Demonstrate an implementation of attestation between two enclaves

#### [Attested TLS](attested_tls/README.md)

- Explain what an Attested TLS channel is
- Demonstrate an implementation for how to establish an Attested TLS channel
  - between two enclaves
  - between one non-enclave client and an enclave

#### [Switchless Calls](switchless/README.md)

- Explain the concept of switchless calls
- Identify cases where switchless calls are appropriate
- Demonstrate how to mark a function as `transition_using_threads` in EDL
- Demonstrate how to configure an enclave to enable switchless calls originated within it
- Recommend the number of host worker threads required for switchless calls in practice
- Demonstrate how to enable switchless calls in an enclave application

#### [Host-side Enclave Verification](host_verify/README.md)

- Explain the concept of host-side enclave verification
- Demonstrate attestation of a remote SGX enclave from outside an enclave

#### [Pluggable Allocators](pluggable_allocator/README.md)

- Demonstrate how to replace the default memory allocator by plugging in a custom allocator
  that performs better in multi-threaded enclaves.
- Provide overview of how to make an enclave-compatible allocator pluggable.
