** syscall.edl:
**
**     This file declares OCALLs and ECALLs needed by the enclave to implement
**     various system operations, such as file and socket I/O. Implementations
**     are provided for both Linux and Windows here:
**
**         ../host/linux/syscall.c
**         ../host/windows/syscall.c
**
**     The file declares host-side support for the SYSCALL feature. Within the
**     enclave, this subset functions as a portable abstration layer.
