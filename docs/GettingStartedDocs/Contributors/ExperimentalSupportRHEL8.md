# Experimental - Getting Started with Open Enclave on RHEL8

## Platform requirements

- RHEL8
- A machine with an Intel processor.

Please refer to [SGXSupportLevel.md](/docs/GettingStartedDocs/SGXSupportLevel.md) to determine the SGX support level for your target system. If your system does not have SGX1 or SGX1+FLC support, you can use the simulation mode.

Note: Attestation is not supported on RHEL8.

## Clone Open Enclave SDK repo from GitHub

Install git.

```bash
sudo yum install git
```

Use the following command to download the source code (make sure `git` is installed before doing this):

```bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/openenclave/openenclave.git
```

This creates a source tree under the directory called openenclave.

## Install project requirements

First, change directory into the openenclave repository:

```bash
cd openenclave
```

Ansible is required to install the project requirements. If not already installed, you can install it by running:

```bash
sudo scripts/ansible/install-ansible.sh
```

Install the prerequisites.

```bash
ansible-playbook scripts/ansible/oe-contributors-setup-sgx1.yml
```

## Build

To build first create a build directory ("build/" in the example below) and change into it.

```bash
mkdir build/
cd build/
```

Then run `cmake` to configure the build and generate the make files and build:

```bash
cmake ..
make
ctest
```

## Run unit tests

After building, run all unit test cases using `ctest` to confirm the SDK is built and working as expected.

Run the following command from the build directory if your system supports SGX1 or SGX1+FLC:

```bash
ctest
```

If your system does not have SGX support, run the following:

```bash
OE_SIMULATION=1 ctest
```

You will see test logs similar to the following:

```bash
Test project /home/youradminusername/openenclave/build
      Start   1: tests/aesm
1/123 Test   #1: tests/aesm ...............................................................................................................   Passed    0.98 sec
      Start   2: tests/mem
2/123 Test   #2: tests/mem ................................................................................................................   Passed    0.00 sec
      Start   3: tests/str
3/123 Test   #3: tests/str ................................................................................................................   Passed    0.00 sec
....

122/123 Test #122: tools/oedump .............................................................................................................   Passed    0.00 sec
            Start 123: oeelf
123/123 Test #123: oeelf ....................................................................................................................   Passed    0.00 sec

100% tests passed, 0 tests failed out of 123

Total Test time (real) =  83.61 sec
```

A clean pass of the above unit tests is an indication that your Open Enclave setup was successful.

You can start playing with the Open Enclave samples after following the instructions in the "Install" section below to configure samples for building,

For more information refer to the [Advanced Test Info](AdvancedTestInfo.md) document.

## Install

 Follow the instructions in the [Install Info](LinuxInstallInfo.md) document to install the Open Enclave SDK built above.

## Build and run samples

To build and run the samples, please look at [README_Linux.md](/samples/README_Linux.md).
