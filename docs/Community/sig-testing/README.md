Testing Special Interest Group
========================================

This SIG is specifically interested in making it easier for the OE SDK community
to run and contribute tests, as well as integrate downstream testing, to ensure
the OE SDK is stable across a wide range of hardware and use-cases.

This SIG is responsible for defining the overall approach to testing OE SDK
itself, performing third-party testing and validation, and reviewing PRs that
affect *how* testing is performed broadly.

This SIG may also weigh in on specific PRs, though generally speaking, other
SIGs should be responsible for test coverage within their respective domains.
