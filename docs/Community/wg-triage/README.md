Triage Working Group
======

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triage

    Triage is the process of determining the priority of patients' treatments
    based on the severity of their condition or likelihood of recovery with and
    without treatment.

Within the Open Enclave SDK project, we use the term "triage" to refer to one
stage in the
[process of bug management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_bug#Bug_management),
namely the classification of incoming issues and PRs.

How We Do It
------------

Held once a week, a regular triage meeting provides a touch-point for
development cycle alignment and ensures that no new-contributor issue goes
untouched for too long.

*Note(Aeva) we don't currently have a process to measure or track issue health
**after triage** to ensure that issues do not become stale ... but we should*

Meetings
--------
Triage meetings are open to everyone. If you have recently filed an issue or a
PR, you may want to attend the next triage meeting and help with classification.
**Regular Triage meeting**: Weekly on Mondays at 11:00 PT (Pacific Time)
