Remote Attestation Endorsements
=====

Attestation is the process of proving the authenticity of a
Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) platform (HW + software).

In the current API, the OE SDK has functions to get the evidence and to verify
the evidence.  This document describes additional changes to the API to
support the concept of endorsements. Endorsements are additional information
from a second source that the verifier can use for attestation verification.

Terminology
----------
From Remote Attestation Procedures Architecture (RATS)
(https://github.com/ietf-rats-wg/architecture).  This
a draft that is Work in Progress and subject to change.

- Evidence is a set of information about an Attester that is to be
  appraised by a Verifier.

- Appraisal Policy for Evidence is a set of rules that direct how a
  Verifier evaluates the validity of information about an Attester.

- Endorsements are secure statements that some entity (typically a
  manufacturer) vouches for the integrity of an Attester's signing
  capability.

- Attestation Results are the output generated by a Verifier, typically
  including information about an Attester, where the Verifier vouches
  for the validity of the results.

### Roles
RATS roles are implemented by principals that possess cryptographic
keys used to protect and appraise Evidence or Attestation Results.

#### Attester:
An entity whose attributes must be appraised in order to determine
whether the entity is considered trustworthy, such as when deciding
whether the entity is authorized to perform some operation.

#### Verifier:
An entity that appraises the validity of Evidence about an Attester.

#### Endorser:
An entity that creates Endorsements that can be used to help to appraise
the trustworthiness of Attesters.

#### Relying Party:
An entity that depends on the validity of information about another
entity, typically for purposes of authorization.

                Figure 1: Conceptual Data Flow

An Attester creates Evidence that is conveyed to a Verifier.

The Verifier uses the Evidence, and any Endorsements from Endorsers,
by applying an Evidence Appraisal Policy to assess the trustworthiness
of the Attester, and generates Attestation Results for use by Relying
Parties. The Evidence Appraisal Policy might be obtained from an Endorser
along with the Endorsements, or might be obtained via some other mechanism
such as being configured in the Verifier by an administrator.

The Relying Party uses Attestation Results by applying its own Appraisal
Policy to make application-specific decisions such as authorization
decisions. The Attestation Result Appraisal Policy might, for example, be
configured in the Relying Party by an administrator.

Motivation
----------

Currently, the existing endorsements used for Intel SGX quote verification are not exposed to the user.
This makes it difficult for the verifier to specify his/her own set of Evidence appraisal policies.
Adding these new APIs allows the verifier to specify an Evidence appraisal policy of his/her choosing.
Possible policies:
1. The verifier has the option to specify its set of endorsements during verification.
2. The verifier has the option to provide a datetime to use during verification.
This datetime specifies the date and time at which the verifier wants to do the verification.
If no datetime is provided, the datetime when the endorsements were created is used during verification.
The verifier can provide a datetime in the past, enabling auditing of the evidence and endorsements.


User Experience
---------------

There are 2 scenarios. Note that to get the endorsements,
currently requires a Data Center Attestation Primitives (DCAP)
client that runs outside the enclave.

### 1. Verifier is provided with endorsements:
In this scenario the attester provides the evidence and endorsements to the verifier.
The verifier is then free to use these to verify the TEE.

##### Attester generates the evidence and fetches the endorsements from the endorser (inside an enclave/TEE)
```C
...
result = oe_get_evidence(
    OE_EVIDENCE_FLAGS_REMOTE_ATTESTATION,
    NULL, // custom_claims
    0,
    NULL, // opt_params
    0,
    &evidence,
    &evidence_size,
    &endorsements,
    &endorsements_size);
...
```

##### Verifier verifies the evidence and endorsements (in an untrusted host or inside an enclave/TEE)
```C
...

// Verify report with endorsements
result = oe_verify_evidence(
            evidence,
            evidence_size,
            endorsements,
            endorsements_size,
            NULL,  // opt_params
            0,
            &claims,
            &claims_size);
...
```

The above example assumes that the Evidence appraisal policy is done
primarily underneath the API, rather than in the application.

### 2. Verifier fetches endorsements:
In this scenario the attester only provides the evidence to the verifier.  The
verifier then fetches the endorsements from the endorser (a second source
different than the OE SDK), and uses the evidence and endorsements to verify
the TEE.

##### Attester generates the evidence (inside an enclave/TEE)
```C
...
result = oe_get_evidence(
    OE_EVIDENCE_FLAGS_REMOTE_ATTESTATION,
    NULL, // custom_claims
    0,
    NULL, // opt_params
    0,
    &evidence,
    &evidence_size,
    &endorsements,
    &endorsements_size);
...
```

##### Verifier verifies the evidence with custom endorsements (in the untrusted host or inside an enclave/TEE)
```C
...
//
// Verifier gets endorsements not using OE SDK
//

//
// Verifier builds **endorsements** structure
//
endorsements_external = ...
endorsements_external_size = ...

// Verify evidence with external endorsements
result = oe_verify_evidence(
            report,
            report_size,
            endorsements_external,
            endorsements_external_size,
            NULL,  // opt_params
            0,
            &claims,
            &claims_size);
...
```

The above example still assumes that the Evidence appraisal policy is done
primarily underneath the API, rather than in the application.

### New Public Attestation functions

These functions supersede the existing functions:
1. `oe_get_evidence()` supersedes `oe_get_report()`
2. `oe_verify_evidence()` supersedes `oe_verify_report()`

Users should start using these new experimental functions.  `oe_get_report()` and `oe_verify_report()`
are deprecated and will be removed in future releases.

These functions will sit on top of the plug-in attestation framework.  For more information please
see the [attestation plug-in design doc](CustomAttestation.md).  In short, the actual implementation
of these functions will depend on which plug-in is registered.  By default there will
be a built-in SGX plug-in.

`common/sgx/attestation.c`
```C

 *
 * For local attestation:
 *  - This function can be called from the TEE/enclave or the untrusted host.
 *
 * @param[in] flags Specifying default value (0) generates evidence for local
 * attestation. Specifying OE_EVIDENCE_FLAGS_REMOTE_ATTESTATION generates
 * evidence for remote attestation.
 * @param[in] custom_claims A buffer to the optional custom claims.
 * @param[in] custom_claims_size The size in bytes of custom_claims.
 * @param[in] opt_params Optional additional parameters needed for the current
 * enclave type.
 *     For SGX:
 *        This can be sgx_target_info_t for local attestation.
 * @param[in] opt_params_size The size of the **opt_params** buffer.
 * @param[out] evidence_buffer This points to the resulting evidence upon success.
 * @param[out] evidence_buffer_size This is set to the size of the evidence buffer
 * on success.
 * @param[out] endorsements_buffer The buffer containing the endorsements to parse.
 * @param[out] endorsements_buffer_size The size of the **endorsements_buffer**.

As part of the claims form `oe_verify_evidence()`, there will be a validity

### OE Host Verify Library

The OE Host Verify library is a standalone library used for verifying remote reports outside
the TEE/enclave. The function `oe_verify_remote_report()` will be updated to support
endorsements.
